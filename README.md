# rock-paper-scissors 

This a rock paper scissors project from Udacity

In this project, you'll apply your Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors.
You'll build classes that represent the game and its players. You'll write computer players that follow various different strategies,
as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.

You'll start this project with a piece of starter code that doesn't quite know how to play Rock Paper Scissors yet.
In fact, it contains a computer player class that only knows how to play rock.
